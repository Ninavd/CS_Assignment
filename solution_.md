**beer consumption plot**

Beer consumption in NL was fairly constant until about 2012, since then it has majorly increased. We can not be sure if this is entirely due to the increase in students, since the drastic increase in number of students already started 3 years before the rise in beer consumption, but there does seem to be some type of correlation in the years after 2012.
